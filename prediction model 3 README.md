##Stock Price Prediction Dashboard

This project provides a comprehensive dashboard for stock price prediction using various machine learning models. The dashboard is built using Dash, a Python framework for building analytical web applications, and integrates several machine learning models for time series forecasting.

##Features
Stock Data Visualization: Visualize historical stock data for various metrics such as Close, Open, High, and Low prices.

##Model Selection: Choose from a variety of machine learning models including LSTM, GRU, Simple RNN, Dense, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Linear Regression.

#Hyperparameter Tuning: Automatically tunes hyperparameters for the selected model to achieve the best performance.

Future Predictions: Predict future stock prices based on the trained model.

Performance Metrics: Visualize the performance of different hyperparameters to understand their impact on the model's accuracy.
